This project is for a compulsory database course I took in university, the project was made in about a month, so don't have high expectations for a sexy-looking codebase.

In this course we weren't allowed to use any programming language other than Java for building the project (which I hate, cuz it's obnoxiously verbose), despite the course being named "Database Systems" and not "A Java Project".

I used PostgreSQL, which is "The world's most advanced open source database" as they say on their website.

Feel free to use this project in any way you want.
